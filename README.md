# Machine-Learning

This repository serves as conversion from Octave to Python.

As you may know, Machine Learning course found in coursera.org created by Andrew Ng is one of the most not the most influential courses in the world. 
It plays a huge role in shaping beginners' minds that want to have a glimpse on Machine Learning industry, the most renowned algorithms implemented out there.
The course bases heavily on the use of Octave Tool, for its simplicity and its fast ability to calculate rapidly vectorized calculations.
That is why I took the liberty in using python and helping others implement the assignments' tasks using python.
